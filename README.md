## Directories

### `data`

The data directory contains our uncompiled assets such as images, icons or json files.


### `components`

The components directory contains our React.js components. Components make up the different parts of our pages and can be reused and imported into our pages, layouts and even other components.


### `layouts`

Layouts are a great help when you want to change the look and feel of the app, whether you want to include a sidebar or have distinct layouts for mobile and desktop. The layouts directory provide a set of components inspired by the **Every Layout** book, by Heydon Pickering. 

### `pages`

This directory contains our application views and routes.
